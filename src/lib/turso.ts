// This file is deprecated - database operations now go through API routes
// All database functionality has been moved to /api/lib/turso.ts for security

// If you need to add new database operations:
// 1. Add them to the appropriate API route in /api/
// 2. Create corresponding client-side functions that call the API
// 3. Update the client code to use the new API functions
